1. CORE ASSETS & IDENTITY:
• Official Icon: Use the attached Senku-icon.png as the site's Favicon and main Navbar Logo.
• The Soul: MUST KEEP the existing senku.GIF as the core dashboard background. Do not delete or replace it.
• Project Name: Senku Protocol.
• Founder: Bader Alkorgli.
2. THE NEURAL ENTRY PORTAL (First Impression):
• Create a high-end "Neural Link" splash screen before the dashboard.
• Centerpiece: A pulsing, neon-green circular orb containing the Senku-icon.png.
• Animation: Below the orb, a sleek loading bar with neon text: "INITIATING NEURAL LINK TO SENKU LABS...".
• Transition: Once loaded, it should vanish with a "digital glitch" or "fade-out" effect to reveal the main lab (senku.GIF).
3. THE "FLOATING MASCOT" (SuperRouter Style):
• Implement a Floating Animated Mascot inspired by superrouter.fun.
• Position a small, transparent version of the "Senku Character" in the bottom-right corner.
• Logic: Apply a continuous CSS "Floating/Bobbing" animation.
• Interaction: On hover, a neon speech bubble appears: "SCIENTIFIC STATUS: OPTIMAL".
4. THE VIRAL SCIENTIFIC PASSPORT (World-Class Digital ID):
• Visuals: Redesign the Passport into a prestigious Glassmorphism ID Card.
• Dynamic Ranks: The card's aura/color must change based on wallet strength:
• Green: Rookie Analyst.
• Blue: Quantum Specialist.
• Purple/Gold: Legendary Scientist.
• Features: Display Wallet Address, a Unique "Neural ID", and a "Verified by Senku AI" glowing seal.
• Viral Loop: Add a prominent "Share on X" button that generates a high-quality image of the card to dominate the CT timeline.
5. LIVE DATA & LOGIC (Solana RPC):
• Quantum Audit (Rug Check): Transform it from a UI into a real tool. Use Solana RPC to fetch: Holder Count, LP Burned/Locked status, Bundled Wallets, and Contract Renouncement.
• The 100% Fix: Ensure the scanner hits exactly 100% before displaying the "Scientific Verdict".
• Mobile Parity: Every feature (Audit, Radar, Passport) must be 100% responsive and look perfect on mobile devices.
6. STRATEGIC UTILITY & FOOTER:
• Day 1 Logic: Add a glowing top banner: "LAB STATUS: OPEN ACCESS (DAY 1). $SENKU TOKEN REQUIRED STARTING DAY 2."
• Enterprise Footer: 3-Column Layout:
